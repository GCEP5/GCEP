## Project Name: 
Generalized Chiller Efficiency Predictor 
## Sponsor
Optimum Energy
## Golas
Build a Model that can predict the efficiency of another chiller
## Steps
* Data Mining
	* Feature Elimination
	* Data Cleaning and Validation
* Build ML Models
	* Linear & Non-Linear
	* No Neural Network & Decision Trees & Deep Learning
* Optimize ML Models
	* Equation

## Update
* Build Model for each chiller, and use chiller level as classification.
* Optimize the model and add con_evp bundle as factors.
* Use Neural Network to make optimization.
