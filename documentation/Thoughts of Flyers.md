## Title: 
Generalized Chiller Efficiency Predictor (The Project Name)

Prediction of Generalized Chiller Efficiency by using Machine Learning Method(The one I prefer)

## Description:
For large HAVC systems,  centrifugal chillers are large, centralized and custom-built, which lead to a variety of bundle sizes and motor sizes for chiller systems and makes the efficiency for chillers hard to predict. In this project sponsored by Optimum Energy LLC, we use several regression approaches to find the most accurate prediction model based on the existing time series chiller data. We are using polynomial regression as our machine learning model that can predict most of the chiller efficiency within an error of +- .03 kW/Ton.
